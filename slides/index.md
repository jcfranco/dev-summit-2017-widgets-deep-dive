---

# Prereqs

- Accessor
- TypeScript

---

# TypeScript

- Leverage ES6 (syntactic sugar)
- Interfaces
- Typing
- const and let vs var
- remove binding for () => {}

---

# Internal development lifecycle

TBD? JC?

---

# Before porting

- rethink APIs
- restrucuring
- porting locate/track
- porting search
- portiong home

---

# Tasks

- installing npm/grunt
- compile ts/sass

---

# Porting

Go through all the things we do to port a widget to 4x.

Let's go deep!

---

# API consistency

- things to consider for collections/accessor

---

# Porting: Real Nodes

---


# Porting: JSX

- focusing nodes
  - storing reference to them
- Using JSX to hide nodes
  - toggling classes
  - joining classes
  - using es6 templates
  - JSX key attribute
  - accessibleHandler
  - JSX storing data on attributes

---

todo: matt - jsx demo with basic widget.

todo: matt - cover BEM and CSS object.

---

# Porting: ViewModels

- Rethinking APIs
  - More collections
  - More Accessors
  - View properties instead of events
  - readonly properties
- Support modules
  - Offloading logic where appropriate. More modular
- Autocasting

---

# Porting: Styling

- CSS to Sass
  - Variables
  - Theming
  - Mixins
  - etc.
- BEM
- Icon font / SVG
- Organized class names, CSS object
