# The boilerplate

[Preview boilerplate](https://arcgis.github.io/presentations-devsummit-2017/default-DS17/)

 Steps to use the biolierplate for your own presentation in this repo:
 * Get the repo set up lcoally
 * Copy "default-DS17" to your own folder, giving it a good descriptive name based on your presentation title.
 * Add a section on this page with quicklink, presenters, session title.
 * Edit the meta tags in the index.html in your new folder.
 * Write your presentation in the index.html in your new folder.

Note that we're making each presentation it's own folder.  In theory, we could also have had all the presentations in one folder, with different html/markdown files.
